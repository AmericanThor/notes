                    ~These are my Javascript notes~

<!-- Retrieve a reference node using: -->

document.getElement 
&
document.getElementsByTagName(tagname)

<!-- Create an Element by -->
document.createElement and placing it using insertBefore, appendChild, or replaceChild

<!-- Modify Elements -->
element.innerHTML, element.style, & element.setAttribute

<!-- Write a string in the console for the browswer using: -->

window.dump("Here is your message")



<!-- ASSIGNMENT Opperators -->
= operator is used to assign value on the right to the variable on left
+= operator is used to increment the value stored in the left operand by the value of the right operand and store it back to the left operand (the same as writing tmp = tmp + val where tmp is a variable and val is some arbitrary value)
-= operator is used to decrement the value stored in the left operand by the value of the right operand and store it back to the left operand (the same as writing tmp = tmp - val where tmp is a variable and val is some arbitrary value)
*= operator is used to multiply the value stored in the left operand by the value of the right operand and store it back to the left operand (the same as writing tmp = tmp * val where tmp is a variable and val is some arbitrary value)
/= operator is used to divide the value stored in the left operand by the value of the right operand and store it back to the left operand (the same as writing tmp = tmp / val where tmp is a variable and val is some arbitrary value)
**= operator is used to raise the value stored in the left operand to the power value of the right operand and store it back to the left operand (the same as writing tmp = tmp ** val where tmp is a variable and val is some arbitrary value)
%= operator is used to get modulus of the value stored in the left operand by value of the right operand and store it back to the left operand (the same as writing tmp = tmp % val where tmp is a variable and val is some arbitrary value)

<!-- COMPARISON Opperators -->
== operator checks if the operand on the left is of equal value to the operand on right
=== operator checks if the operand on the left is of equal value and equal type to the operand on right
!= operator checks if the operand on the left is not of equal value to the operand on right
> operator checks if the operand on the left is greater than that on the right
< operator checks if the operand on the left is lesser than that on the right
>= operator checks if the operand on the left is greater than or equal to that on the right
<= operator checks if the operand on the left is lesser than or equal to that on the right
